# TODO

This is app to adding thing todo. I know that internet is full of apps like this, but I just want to train my caching skills.

## How does it works?

If you want to check this app, you can go [here](aleksanderskubala.github.io/todo-pure), or download install files in dir: todo-build => todo.apk is for android, todo-windows is for Windows.

App is saving your todos in cache, so you can slose winodw and reopen.

App has got a Pommodoro Tracker so you can do work-sessions.
