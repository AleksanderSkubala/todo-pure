# TODO

This is app to adding things todo. I know, that internet is full of apps like this, but I just want to train my caching skills.

## How does it works?

If you want to check this app, you can:

> Go [here](https://aleksanderskubala.github.io/todo-pure).
### or
> Download install files in dir todo-build => todo.apk is for android

App is saving your todos in cache, so you can close winodw and then reopen with all todos.

App has got a Pommodoro Tracker so you can do work-sessions.
